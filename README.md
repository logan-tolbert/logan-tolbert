# 👋 Hi, I'm Logan Tolbert

I'm an aspiring software developer with a passion for building, learning, and exploring the deeper layers of software engineering. After over a decade working as a mechanic, I transitioned into software development to pursue a more fulfilling and future-facing career.

## 🚀 About Me

My love for technology runs deep—I've always been curious about how things work, whether it's an engine or an application. That curiosity led me to programming and eventually to graduate from the [TrueCoders](https://truecoder.io) software development bootcamp.

Since then, I’ve been focused on sharpening my skills in full-stack web development, particularly with C# and .NET. But more than just building web apps, I’m passionate about understanding *how systems are built*—diving into architecture, library design, and infrastructure.

I'm a quick learner, not afraid to get into source code, and always exploring how I can turn ideas into useful, real-world software. I also enjoy playing guitar 🎸 and tinkering with ways to combine music and tech.
